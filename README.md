# One-Page Flexbox Page

Welcome to my one-page site! This document serves as an overview and guide to navigate through the site I've developed to showcase my skills. The website is a single HTML page, meticulously styled with CSS leveraging the powerful Flexbox layout model to create a responsive and modern user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic markup to structure the page content effectively.
- **CSS3:** Advanced styling techniques including Flexbox for layout, custom properties (variables), and media queries for responsiveness.
